      <h1>Early Life</h1>
      <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
        Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
        Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
        Nadu.
      </p>
      <p>
        His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local
        mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
      </p>
      <p>
        His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
        Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest
        of four brothers and one sister in his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
        ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
        from Arab traders and local women.
      </p>
      <p>
        The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
        and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims
        between the mainland and Pamban.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
        the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.

      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>
        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
        the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.
      </p>
      <p>
        He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After
        completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
        Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
        Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
        where he graduated in physics in 1954.
      </p>
      <p>
        He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras
        Institute of Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
        dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
        scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I
        was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult
        deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a
        fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
        positions were available in the IAF.
