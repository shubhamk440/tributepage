      <h1>Additional Information</h1>
      <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist
        and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
        2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
        aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
        science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
        was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
        missile development efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
        development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
        played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
        India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
        nuclear test by India in 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
        support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
        "People's President",
      </p>
      <p>
        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
        Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27
        July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
        attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where
        he was buried with full state honours.
