      <h1>Career As A Scientist</h1>
      <p>
        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam
        joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation as a scientist after becoming a
        member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
      </p>
      <p>
        He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
        unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam joined the INCOSPAR,
        working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first
        Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969,
        Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
        where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch
        Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
        near-earth orbit in July 1980.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
        independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's
        approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton,
        Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and
        Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an
        effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III
        projects, both of which proved to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost
        coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".In 2012, the duo designed a
        rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named
        the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

      <h1>Careee As A President</h1>
      <p>
        Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.
        He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884,
        surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from
        25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in
        power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post
        of President,[40][41] and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist
        Congress Party backed his candidacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan
        chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[44]
        Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature. On 18 June, Kalam
        filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by
        Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in
        Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the
        election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone
        conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy
        victory,[48] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in
        on 25 July.
